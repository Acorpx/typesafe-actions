# Contribution Guide
1. Make sure you have read and understand the **Motivation** section to be aligned with project history and goals.
2. Before submitting a PR please comment in the existing issue (or create a new one if necessary) to discuss the planned work (this will prevent rejecting the PR and wasting your work).
3. All workflow scripts (prettier, linter, tests) must pass successfully.
4. Code coverage should not decline both in terms of type and runtime unit tests.
